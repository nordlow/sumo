;; Spatial reasoning problems
;; starting with word problems, then later coding the formal query and solution in SUMO

(1), (2), (13) are from https://www.cosy.informatik.uni-bremen.de/sites/default/files/ByrneJohnson-Laird89.pdf

(1) A is on the right of B
    C is on the left of B
    Hence, A is on the right of C

(orientation A B Right)
(orientation C B Left)

need to add to SUMO:

(=>
  (and
    (orientation ?X ?Y ?R)
    (orientation ?Y ?Z ?R))
  (orientation ?X ?Z ?R))

proof will involve

(<=>
    (orientation ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2 Right)
    (orientation ?OBJ2 ?OBJ1 Left))

query: (orientation A C Right)

proof: (over tinySUMO.kif)

1. (not (orientation A C Right)) [] negated_conjecture

2. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (=> (and (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR4 ?VAR1) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR1)) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR4 ?VAR1))) [] kb_SUMO_2

3. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (or (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR4 ?VAR1) (not (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR4 ?VAR1)) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR1)))) [2] ennf_transformation

4. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (or (or (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR4 ?VAR1) (not (orientation ?VAR3 ?VAR4 ?VAR1))) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR1)))) [3] flattening

5. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2 ?VAR3 ?VAR4) (or (or (orientation ?VAR4 ?VAR3 ?VAR2) (not (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR3 ?VAR2))) (not (orientation ?VAR4 ?VAR1 ?VAR2)))) [4] cnf_transformation

6. (forall (?VAR1) (or (not (orientation ?VAR1 C Right)) (not (orientation A ?VAR1 Right)))) [1, 5] resolution

7. (orientation A B Right) [] kb_SUMO_114

8. (not (orientation B C Right)) [6, 7] resolution

9. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2) (and (=> (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left) (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right)) (=> (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right) (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left)))) [] kb_SUMO_1

10. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2) (and (or (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left))) (or (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left) (not (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right))))) [9] ennf_transformation

11. (forall (?VAR1 ?VAR2) (or (orientation ?VAR1 ?VAR2 Right) (not (orientation ?VAR2 ?VAR1 Left)))) [10] cnf_transformation

12. (not (orientation C B Left)) [8, 11] resolution

13. (orientation C B Left) [] kb_SUMO_115

14. false [12, 13] subsumption_resolution

(2) If x is on the right of y, and z is on the left of y, then x is on the right of z

(<=>
  (orientation ?OBJ1 ?OBJ2 Right)
  (orientation ?OBJ2 ?OBJ1 Left))

We may need to add:

(=>
  (and
    (orientation ?X ?Y Right)
    (orientation ?Z ?Y Left))
 (orientation ?X ?Z Right))

 (11) John is carrying a box.  There is a book on the box.  What is John carrying?

 (12) Jane is standing in front of John.  A van is parked in front of John. John cannot see Jane.  Is the van in front of Jane?

(13) A is on the right of B
     C is on the left of B
     D is in front of C
     E is in front of B.
       Therefore D is on the left of E

       a. Left (x,y> & Front (z, x) + Left (front
       (z, x), y), where the right-hand side signifies
       “z is in front of x, all of which is on the left
       of y.”
       b. Left (x, y) & Front (z, y) + Left (x,
       front (z, y)), where the right-hand side signifies “x is on the left of z which is in front
       of y.”
       c. Left (x, y) & Left (u, z) -+ Left (x, left
       6J3 z)).
       d. Left (x, y) * Right ty, x).
       e. Left (front (x, y), z) + Left (x, z) &
       Left (y, z) & Front (x, y).
