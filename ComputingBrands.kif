(documentation Jailbreaking EnglishLanguage "A jailbreak is the act or tool used to perform
the act of breaking out of a chroot or jail in UNIX-like operating systems or bypassing
digital rights management (DRM). In the former case, it allows the user to see files outside
of the filesystem that the administrator intends to make available to the application or
user in question. In the context of DRM, this allows the user to run arbitrarily defined
code on devices with DRM as well as break out of chroot-like restrictions. The term
originated with the iPhone/iOS jailbreaking community and has also been used as a term for
PlayStation Portable hacking; these devices have repeatedly been subject to jailbreaks,
allowing the execution of arbitrary code, and sometimes have had those jailbreaks disabled
by vendor updates. (from Wikipedia)")
